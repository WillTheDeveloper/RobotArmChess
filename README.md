# Robot Arm Chess

## Concept overview

The idea behind this, is to bring the robot arm and 3d printing capabilities together to make a rabot arm that you can play Chess against in person.

## Factors that need considering

- [ ] Are we making the chess board modular to allow for easy fixing of the magnets inside.
- [ ] Figure out dimensions of robot arm to allow attachment to chess board directly.
- [ ] What programming language do we need to write the software in?

## Ideas so far

- Using magnets on the chess pieces in order to pick them up more effeciently than using claws.
- On the arm which will grab the pieces, use an electromagnet to easily pick it up and drop it using varying voltages.
- The chess board will hold magnets to allow the pieces to snap to the grid more easily.

## Investments

*Funded primarily by Will*

- This is going to require a lot of material especially during the prototyping stages.
- Could look into getting a new part for the 3d printer, which would allow for multiple colours to be printed, for example the black and white grid of the chess board.
